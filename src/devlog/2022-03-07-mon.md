On the weekend I did a spot of hacking on the Agda compiler. I found out that the input for the HTML back-end is actually a token stream. That is, the input is what you would expect to get after lexing (not parsing). However, what's interesting is that there is a piece of data attached to each token called aspect which tells the HTML backend what colour to highlight it. I feel like this data could only be gleaned by parsing.

So we seem to have an interesting situation where parsing is done but the the token stream is re-annotated with extra information.

Here's an example of the first token on a line that specifies the type signature of `swap`.

```agda
( 1294
,"swap"
, Aspects
    { aspect = Just (Name (Just Function) False)
    , otherAspects = fromList []
    , note = ""
    , definitionSite =
         Just (DefinitionSite
           { defSiteModule =
                TopLevelModuleName
                  { moduleNameRange = NoRange
                  , moduleNameParts = "Data" :| ["Sum","Base"]}
                  , defSitePos = 1294
                  , defSiteHere = True
                  , defSiteAnchor = Just "swap"
            })
    , tokenBased = NotOnlyTokenBased})
```

This is the `Aspect` data structure.

```Agda
data Aspect
  = Comment
  | Keyword
  | String
  | Number
  | Hole
  | Symbol                     -- ^ Symbols like forall, =, ->, etc.
  | PrimitiveType              -- ^ Things like Set and Prop.
  | Name (Maybe NameKind) Bool -- ^ Is the name an operator part?
  | Pragma                     -- ^ Text occurring in pragmas that
                               --   does not have a more specific
                               --   aspect.
  | Background                 -- ^ Non-code contents in literate Agda
  | Markup
    -- ^ Delimiters used to separate the Agda code blocks from the
    -- other contents in literate Agda
    deriving (Eq, Show, Generic)
```

It seems that the HTML backend does recover the token stream from teh abstract syntax.

Module `Agda.Interaction.Highlighting.FromAbstract` has this at the top:

```
-- | Extract highlighting syntax from abstract syntax.
--
-- Implements one big fold over abstract syntax.
```

It works on the data type from module `Agda.Syntax.Abstract` which has this as its header:

```
{-| The abstract syntax. This is what you get after desugaring and scope
    analysis of the concrete syntax. The type checker works on abstract syntax,
    producing internal syntax ("Agda.Syntax.Internal").
-}
```

The entry point to the highlighter is in module `Agda.Interaction.Highlighting.FromAbstract` and it has the following signature:

```
runHighlighter ::
  Hilite a =>
  SourceToModule -> AbsolutePath -> NameKinds -> a ->
  HighlightingInfoBuilder
```

As you can see there is a `Hilite` type class. Many instances are defined in the module. Here is the one for declarations.

```
instance Hilite A.Declaration where
  hilite = \case
      A.Axiom _ax _di ai _occ x e            -> hl ai <> hl x <> hl e
      A.Generalize _names _di ai x e         -> hl ai <> hl x <> hl e
      A.Field _di x e                        -> hlField x <> hl e
      A.Primitive _di x e                    -> hl x <> hl e
      A.Mutual _mi ds                        -> hl ds
      A.Section _r x tel ds                  -> hl x <> hl tel <> hl ds
      A.Apply mi x a _ci dir                 -> hl mi <> hl x <> hl a <> hl dir
      A.Import mi x dir                      -> hl mi <> hl x <> hl dir
      A.Open mi x dir                        -> hl mi <> hl x <> hl dir
      A.FunDef _di x _delayed cs             -> hl x <> hl cs
      A.DataSig _di x tel e                  -> hl x <> hl tel <> hl e
      A.DataDef _di x _uc pars cs            -> hl x <> hl pars <> hl cs
      A.RecSig _di x tel e                   -> hl x <> hl tel <> hl e
      A.RecDef _di x _uc dir bs e ds         -> hl x <> hl dir <> hl bs <> hl e <> hl ds
      A.PatternSynDef x xs p                 -> hl x <> hl xs <> hl p
      A.UnquoteDecl _mi _di xs e             -> hl xs <> hl e
      A.UnquoteDef _di xs e                  -> hl xs <> hl e
      A.ScopedDecl s ds                      -> hl ds
      A.Pragma _r pragma                     -> hl pragma
    where
    hl      a = hilite a
    hlField x = hiliteField (concreteQualifier x) (concreteBase x) (Just $ bindingSite x)
```

### Running through an example on `FunDef`

Let's see how the highlighting works on `FunDef`. The key line is

```
    A.FunDef _di x _delayed cs             -> hl x <> hl cs
```

Function `hilite` picks out the second field `x` and fourth field `cs`. From module `Agda.Syntax.Abstract` we learn that these have types `x :: QName` and `cs :: [Clause]` respectively:

```
  | FunDef     DefInfo QName Delayed [Clause] -- ^ sequence of function clauses
```

Data type `QName` is defined in `Agda.Syntax.Abstract.Name`

```
data QName = QName { qnameModule :: ModuleName
                   , qnameName   :: Name
                   }
    deriving Data
```

and `Name` is also defined in the same module as:

```
data Name = Name
  { nameId           :: !NameId
  , nameConcrete     :: C.Name  -- ^ The concrete name used for this instance
  , nameCanonical    :: C.Name  -- ^ The concrete name in the original definition (needed by primShowQName, see #4735)
  , nameBindingSite  :: Range
  , nameFixity       :: Fixity'
  , nameIsRecordName :: Bool
      -- ^ Is this the name of the invisible record variable `self`?
      --   Should not be printed or displayed in the context, see issue #3584.
  } deriving Data
```



-------


`runHighlighter` produces a `HighlightingInfoBuilder`

As far as I can tell this produces a `HighlightingInfo` at the end, which is a type synonym for `RangeMap Aspects`. The definition involves a `DelayedMerge` data type for efficiency reasons.

A `RangeMap Aspects` can be thought of as mapping a range, `(Int, Int)`, to an `Aspects` value.


----

Okay, now let's rewind a bit. The token stream is actually produced in
by function `Agda.Interaction.Highlighting.HTML.Base.tokenStream`

```
tokenStream
     :: Text             -- ^ The contents of the module.
     -> HighlightingInfo -- ^ Highlighting information.
     -> [TokenInfo]
```

## What did I learn about the Agda HTML backend?

I learned that the Agda HTML Backend gets its highlighting information from the module _interface_ produced by Agda's type-checking phase. The highlighting information is provided at the level of _tokens_ not abstract syntax which makes it hard to e.g. pull out just a single function definition, since we don't have access to a structure which allows us to do that. We just have tokens and what colour they should be highlighted.
