% Hacking the Agda HTML back end - part 2

Last night I had the thought that I should just modify the `Interface` data structure and add a map from declaration names to highlighting info.

----

I've just modified the `Interface` data structure and done all the necessary plumbing so that now we have a field called `iDeclHighlighting :: Map QName [Aspects]`.

I add to this data structure inside function `Agda.Interaction.Highlighting.Generate.generateAndPrintSyntaxInfo`.

I am just about to test it on `Permutations.agda` and `traceShow` the output. I'm getting excited.

----

It basically worked! Along the way I discovered that the `HighlightingInfo` data structure doesn't actually contain any of the text of the program, just character ranges and "aspects".

So I have completed a new implementation where I store `iDeclRanges :: Map QName Range` in the `Interface` data structure instead.

For a given declaration I can then find the (min, max) of the range using a function called `coveringRange`. Inside the HTML backend the Agda source file is transformed into a token stream of type `[TokenInfo]`. We can easily filter out the tokens that are outside the "covering range".

Thus, we highlight the Agda source file once and then cut snippets out of it and then render these to HTML.

A commit of this proof of concept can be found [here](https://github.com/sseefried/agda/commit/bfe18a1c1bb98265a68b232f8e0df704abad7d4a).
