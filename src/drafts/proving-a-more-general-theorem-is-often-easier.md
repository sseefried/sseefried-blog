## Introduction

When programming, I often "generalise from the specific". I find it easier to work with more concrete concepts first and only later to generalise my solution. At least that's the way I program in languages in which I can't also prove the correctness of my programs.

A simple example of this style of programming might be that I'll write a function to sort a list of integers before going on to generalise it to sort a list of anything that can be ordered.

But I've discovered something counter-intuitive. When you're also interested in proving your programs correct, generalising later can actually be harder. In my experience proofs on specific structures can be a lot harder than proofs on more general structures. If this is true, in general, then it makes sense to do the hard work of generalising one's programs up-front because it will making proving them correct _easier_. Further I suspect the combined work of a) writing the program and proving it correct will be less than b) writing a specific program, trying to prove it, failing, generalising the program and finally proving it correct.

This disparity in difficulty seems counter-intuitive. I suspect it's just a consequence of the fact that general structures, lacking concreteness, are _defined by_ their mathematical properties and these mathematical properties are useful in proving correctness.

In this post I'd like to show you an example of a specific program that was hard to prove correct but became much easier once I had generalised it.

## Bijections that permute a finite set

I defined a _permutation_ as a bijection from `Fin n` to `Fin n` for some `n`. For convenience I renamed `Fin` to `ùîΩ` because I really value conciseness and it has echoes of the `‚Ñï` value defined in module `Data.Nat`.

``` {htmlDir="2022-02-24-permutations" module="Permutations" delimeters="Perm"}
Replaced
```

In Agda a bijection is constructed from:

- a function going in the forward direction: `f`
- a function going in the backwards direction: `f‚Åª¬π`
- a proof that `f‚Åª¬π ‚àò f ‚â° id` i.e. that `f‚Åª¬π` is a left-inverse of `f`
- a proof that `f ‚àò f‚Åª¬π ‚â° id` i.e. that `f‚Åª¬π` is a right-inverse of `f`

## Introducing `+1-mod-n` and `-1-mod-n`

To start I thought I'd play around with a very simple permutation that, in the forward direction, evaluates to the successor of its input modulo `n`.

``` {htmlDir="2022-02-24-permutations" module="Permutations" delimeters="plus-one-mod-n"}
```

And here is its inverse:

``` {htmlDir="2022-02-24-permutations" module="Permutations" delimeters="minus-one-mod-n"}
```

I liked the definition for `-1-mod-n` much better than the definition of `+1-mod-n`, but couldn't think of an alternative way to define the latter. I then got stuck into trying to prove that `-1-mod-n` is the left-inverse of `+1-mod-n`.

The proof took me many hours but eventually I came up with the following. It's a very ugly proof and the only reason I have posted it here is so that you can have the appropriate "ugh"-reaction.

``` {htmlDir="2022-02-24-permutations" module="Permutations" delimeters="ugly-left-inverse-proof"}
```

I also tried to prove that `-1-mod-n` was the right inverse of `+1-mod-n` but got stuck almost straight away and gave up.

## A generalisation of the pattern of permutation

If you look carefully there is an obvious generalisation of the pattern of permutation staring us in the face. Imagine all the possible values of `Fin n` written down, in order, as a list:

```
[ 0, 1, ..., n - 1 ]
```

Now imagine _splitting_ this list into two sub-lists:

```
[ 0, 1, ... n - 2 ] [ n - 1]
```

Now _swap_ the two sub-lists:

```
[n - 1] [ 0, 1, ... n - 2 ]
```

Now _join_ them again:

```
[ n - 1, 0, 1, ... n - 2 ]
```

Now, call this list `P` and imagine that it is indexed by the values of `ùîΩ n`. We find that `P[i] ‚â° +1-mod-n i` for all `i ‚àà ùîΩ n`.

It turns out that there are a number of functions in modules `Data.Fin` and `Data.Sum` that do something very similar to the split-swap-join exercise we just went through above.

The signatures of these functions are:


``` {htmlDir="2022-02-24-permutations" module="Data.Fin.Base" sig="splitAt"}
splitAt definition
```

``` {htmlDir="2022-02-24-permutations" module="Data.Sum.Base" sig="swap"}
swap definition
```

``` {htmlDir="2022-02-24-permutations" module="Data.Fin.Base" sig="join"}
join definition
```

The behaviour of `join` is worth looking at in more detail.

``` {htmlDir="2022-02-24-permutations" module="Data.Fin.Base" fun="join"}
join definition
```

where `[_,_]‚Ä≤` is defined as follows:

``` {htmlDir="2022-02-24-permutations" module="Data.Sum.Base" fun="[_,_]‚Ä≤"}
[_,_]‚Ä≤ definition
```

and

``` {htmlDir="2022-02-24-permutations" module="Data.Sum.Base" fun="[_,_]"}
[_,_] definition
```

Simplifying these means that `join` could be rewritten as:

``` {htmlDir="2022-02-24-permutations" module="Permutations" delimeters="join-direct"}
```

The type signatures of the two functions on the RHS of the definition above are:

``` {htmlDir="2022-02-24-permutations" module="Data.Fin.Base" sig="inject+"}
```
``` {htmlDir="2022-02-24-permutations" module="Data.Fin.Base" sig="raise"}
```

Function `inject+` takes a `Fin m` and "injects" it into the `Fin (m ‚Ñï.+ n)` type without changing the structure of the value. e.g. For value `suc (suc zero) : Fin 3`, `inject+ (suc (suc zero))` evaluates to `suc (suc zero) : Fin 5` for `m = 3` and `n = 2`.

Function `raise` is a little different to `inject+`. It adds `n` to its argument while increasing the size of the type to `Fin (n ‚Ñï.+ m)`. e.g. `raise {3} 2 (suc (suc zero))` evaluates to `suc (suc (suc (suc zero))) : Fin 5`.

We can now now define a function called `splitPermute` that performs the split-swap-join process that I described earlier.

``` {htmlDir="2022-02-24-permutations" module="Permutations" delimeters="splitPermute"}
```

A really nice thing about `splitPermute` is that for a given `m + n` the inverse of `splitPermute m` is `splitPermute n`.

Remember function `+1-mod-n` from earlier?  It is the special case of `splitPermute` where `n = 1`.

Yet the proof that `splitPermute n` is the left inverse of `splitPermute m` is _much simpler_ than the proof that `-1-mod-n` is the left inverse of `+1-mod-n`.

The proof makes use of the following three theorems from `Data.Fin.Properties` and `Data.Sum.Properties`


``` {htmlDir="2022-02-24-permutations" module="Data.Fin.Properties" sig="splitAt-join"}
```
``` {htmlDir="2022-02-24-permutations" module="Data.Sum.Properties" sig="swap-involutive"}
```
``` {htmlDir="2022-02-24-permutations" module="Data.Fin.Properties" sig="join-splitAt"}
```

And here is the proof!

``` {htmlDir="2022-02-24-permutations" module="Permutations" delimeters="inverse-proof"}
```

If you're confused about the use of `cong-[_]‚àò‚ü®_‚ü©‚àò[_]` above. It's just a nice helper function I wrote to help with _setoid_ reasoning on _extensional equality_ (`_‚âó_`). It is defined as follows:

``` {htmlDir="2022-02-24-permutations" module="Permutations" delimeters="composition-cong"}
```

Agda's ability to define mixfix operators using the `_` character really shon here. See how nice the fragment below looks? The parts between the square brackets remain untouched while the law between the angle brackets (`‚ü®‚ü©`) applies a law, in this case: `swap-involutive`.

 ``` {htmlDir="2022-02-24-permutations" module="Permutations" delimeters="inverse-proof-snippet-1"}
```

## Conclusion

In this post I showed you how proving a theorem on a more general formulation of a problem often turns out to be easier than doing it for a specific case. In this particular case you may argue that the specific case could have been defined in terms of `splitAt`, `swap` and `join` _and you'd be correct_. However, I simply didn't spot that at the time. It was only by thinking about the general pattern of permutation that I was able to see that these functions should even be used.

One is likely to generalise a program once a specific solution is found, but proving things on general programs is often easier. Assuming this is true it makes sense to do the work of generalising up-front.
